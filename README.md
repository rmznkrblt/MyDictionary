# MyDictionary

This repository was created to better understand generic structures. The dictionary's structure already exists in c#.

In C#, Dictionary is a generic collection which is generally used to store key/value pairs. The working of Dictionary is quite similar to the non-generic hashtable. The advantage of Dictionary is, it is generic type. Dictionary is defined under System.Collection.Generic namespace. It is dynamic in nature means the size of the dictionary is grows according to the need.
